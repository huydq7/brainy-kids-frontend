00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,700
Woah!

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,690
Got to tell Reggie!

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,510
Hey Reggie! Guess what?

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,380
Shapes are everywhere you look

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,580
Everywhere you look there are shapes

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,620
Shapes are found in everything

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,400
Everything is made up of shapes

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,770
Come on!

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,650
Let's find shapes!

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,140
I see a circle

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,660
I see a square

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,710
I see a triangle over there

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,320
I see a circle

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,890
I see a square

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,890
I see a triangle over there

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,270
Come on kids

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,700
let's draw shapes in the air

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,660
SQUARE!

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,210
TRIANGLE!

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,790
CIRCLE!

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,640
SQUARE!

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,290
TRIANGLE!

23
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,550
CIRCLE!

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,490
FASTER!

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,290
YEAH!
